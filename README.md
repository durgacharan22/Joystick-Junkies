## Project Description:

###### This Application will allow the “Gaming Freaks” to purchase all kinds of Video Games compatible with PS2/PS3/XBOX One/XBOX 360/PS4/etc. at a comparatively cheaper price than its retail price. The objective of this application will be to allow a user to post an advertisement for a particular game he/she wants to sell, specifying the Game Title, Game Genre, Contact Details and most importantly the price they want to sell it for and finally make the advertisement public to everyone around the world.
###### Any registered user will be able to search for a game of their choice through a wide range of game genres available in the application and contact the person who has posted the advertisement to purchase that particular game.
###### we have decided to implement the “Bidding” aspect for the project in which the user can bid for a particular advertisement on the application. The one who posts the advertisement will decide the date and time the bidding will take place. The user will be allocated only a particular time interval to bid for a particular advertisement but will not be allowed to bid before and after the stipulated time interval. We have also considered adding some security features to the application through which the user’s information would remain secure and tamper-free.


## Running our Application:

###### Once you clone our Repository or download the zipped file of it, you will be able to see the Joystick_Junkies workspace, which you need to run inorder to get the application opened in the XCode. Once the application is open, click on the run button to get the application run in the simulator. The default simulator set is Iphone 8 plus. So when you run the application, the simulator opens it in that phone. Here you can perform all the operations possiblein our application. some of them are:
#### * Register in our application.
#### * Log in to our application.
#### * Post an advertisement.
#### * Bid for an advertisement.
#### * Buy a game.
#### * sell a game.
#### * There is no problem if you forget the password, because you can reset it :P.
